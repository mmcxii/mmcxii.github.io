                <p class="section__intro">
                    Hello! My name is Nich Secord, I am a front-end leaning full stack developer (in training
                    until November 2019) based in the Seattle, Washigton area. What I enjoy most about this
                    industry is creating beautiful and responsive layouts that look great on any screen size
                    small or large. I am a proponent of using semantic HTML in tandem with CSS Grid and
                    Flexbox as opposed to "div-soup" to create accesible sites for those that are incapable of
                    viewing the page as well. I am firm in this belief because as stewards of the front-end it
                    is fundamental to our job to ensure that the internet be easy to use for everyone,
                    regardless of ability.
                </p>
                <p class="section__intro">
                    When away from the office I love spending time outdoors and/ or with friends. I enjoy
                    skiing, hiking, and camping; or for a more leisurly time I love a great variety of beer,
                    wine, and spirits. For my money there's no better cocktail than a bourbon Manhattan with a
                    splash of Grand Marnier!

                                This was the first group project I participated in during my Boot Camp in
                                2019. I collaborated on the front-end, creating uniform components to be used
                                across the site. We agreed on a mobile first approach to ensure that the site
                                would look good on screens of all sizes, and I helped my fellow front-end
                                collaborator to learn and use the Sass CSS pre-processor. We agreed to use the
                                BEM class naming convetion to remove the overhead of deciding what to call
                                certain elements, as well as for its ease of use with Sass's nesting
                                functionality.

                                As this was my first collaborative project it was also my introduction to Git
                                and Github's tools for working with teammates such as Branching and Pull
                                Requests. I greatly enjoyed working with my team; we communicated well and
                                took great care in planning who was responsible for which parts of the
                                documents. Thanks to our careful planning we had less than five total merge
                                conflicts and the project was a true joy to work on.

                                This game was my first interaction with any sort of database, in this case
                                Google Firebase. I found this project <em>extremely</em> challenging and it
                                took my longer than any assignment throughout the Boot Camp to this point. To
                                be precise, I had troubles grasping how I was to structure my database calls
                                in conjunction with handling which user was which, and keeping track of users
                                when one would leave the lobby. I am very pleased with how well the app came
                                together in the end after how long I struggled with getting it to function.

                                The theme is based entirely on the card game,
                                <cite>Magic: the Gathering</cite>, a strategy game my friends and I have
                                enjoyed for a decade now. This is one of my favorite designs I have executed
                                in my career; in particular I love the way the buttons change when one is
                                hovered, and how the content cards change color every time the page is loaded.
                                It is a simple design to be sure but the look of the project came together
                                exactly how I pictured it in my mind.

                                This project was my introduction to working with APIs and making requests to
                                get data. Over the course of making this page I learned how to make requests,
                                and set parameters for those requests; for instance in this case I set the
                                limit on how many gifs I would retrieve and the maximum rating those gifs
                                would be allowed to be. I then took the retrieved images and displayed a still
                                on the page, which would then play when it was clicked, and pause when it was
                                clicked again. There is also a search bar which allows users to search GIFY
                                for any topic they want and it will prepend ten new gifs to the page based on
                                their search query.
